%description
This package contains the C++ interfaces to the PR2 hardware components that are
controlled over EtherCAT. This includes the motors and encoders needed to
control the PR2 mechanism, as well as components like the pressure sensors in
the fingertips, camera triggers, etc... All of the hardware components in this
interface are directly available to the controllers inside the hard realtime
control loop.
