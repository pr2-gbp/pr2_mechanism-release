Description: This package contains the robot model that is used by the realtime controllers inside controller manager.
 This robot model focuses on controlling the robot mechanism in a realtime control loop, and therefore it only contains the components of a robot that are relevant in realtime: the robot joints (with encoders, transmisisons and actuators) and the kinematic/dynamic model of the robot. The pr2_mechanism_model package is well tested and is released with a stable API.
